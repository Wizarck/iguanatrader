"""Whitelist-aware L2 append-only triggers for the column-whitelisted
trading tables (audit #35): ``trades``, ``orders``, ``trade_proposals``.

Migration ``0033`` installed full-lock L2 triggers on the *pure* append-only
trading tables (``fills``, ``equity_snapshots``) and deliberately deferred the
three column-whitelisted tables, because those undergo legitimate state
transitions (order submitted→filled, trade open→closed, proposal
pending→approved) restricted to their L1 ``__append_only_mutable_columns__``
whitelist. A blanket block would refuse those legitimate UPDATEs; no block at
all (the status quo) lets raw ``session.execute(text("UPDATE trades SET
quantity = ..."))`` rewrite immutable ledger fields, violating the
"execution logs are immutable" hard rule.

This module emits the missing layer: a BEFORE UPDATE trigger that RAISEs iff a
NON-whitelisted column actually changes (``OLD.c IS NOT NEW.c``), plus a
BEFORE DELETE full lock. That mirrors the L1 ``before_flush`` listener at the
database level, keeping L1 and L2 in lockstep.

Immutability of migrations: the non-whitelisted column lists below are a
STATIC SNAPSHOT as of migration ``0035``. They are NOT derived from the ORM at
runtime — a future column addition must ship its own follow-up migration that
recreates the trigger, exactly as schema changes always do. The lockstep test
``tests/unit/persistence/test_trading_whitelist_l2_triggers.py`` asserts this
snapshot still equals ``ORM columns - whitelist`` for each table, so the drift
(new column not covered by a trigger) fails CI instead of silently shipping an
immutable field that raw SQL can rewrite.

Lives in ``migrations/`` (parallel to ``versions/``) for the same reason as
:mod:`._research_trigger_helpers`: Alembic's revision scanner treats every
module under ``versions/`` as a candidate revision.
